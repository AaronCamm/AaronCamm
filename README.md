### About Me: I enjoy challenging myself in many different areas of life whether that be improving my current skill sets, learning new skills, or improving myself at an intellectual and emotional level. I have a Diploma in Information Technology and a Bachelor of Psychological Science. I am currently working as a Support Worker in the Disability and Mental Health sector. I also run my own business called Bendigo Support Services. If you're a potential employer, look no further, I am an extremely dedicated and hard-working person who will go above and beyond your expectation.
